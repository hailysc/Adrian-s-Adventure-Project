    <button id="buttonOne" onclick="showHideOne()" class="buttonQuestionPurpose">Why make a website like Adrian's Adventure?&nbsp;&#9660;</button>
    <div id="textOne"  class="hiddenOne">
    <p class="purposeTextInfo">We hope to make those who play this game, aware of the issues ocurring in their world. All while inspiring change and spreading the message that they can make a difference. By having a little boy be the protagonist, we instill the fact that you are never too young to be active in the betterment of the world. By not allowing the player to progress in the game when they pick the wrong choice, we hope that itâ€™ll show young readers, what is universally wrong and right when it comes to what is environmentally friendly. We hope to inspire kids to take part in making the right decisions in their communities. We believe that educating children at a young age about wordly problems will solve the issues of the future.</p>
